      <h1><u>My Resume</u></h1>
      <p> My name is Barbora Dejlova.  I started to code when I was 16 years old. I used simple program called Microsoft Frontpage. Because I really like it I've decided to enroll to Lambda School.
       <br>I had my own start up for 5 years, then tried Marketing career. However, marketing didnt fullfill me they way I wanted. 
       <br>My career goals are to help animals by creating websites to change their lives by focusing on their adoption. </p>
